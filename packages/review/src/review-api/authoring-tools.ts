      'Create a review of saved working files, immutable commits or a GitHub PR. Revisions are resolved on acceptance. A worktree target reviews the saved files in its checkout, uncommitted and untracked ones included, against base: the branch to compare against, by default the default branch of the repository. The diff starts at the merge base of base and HEAD, which follows rebases. Omitted commits base means source at head with no diff; supply the parent to review introduced changes. For a GitHub PR, pullRequestUrl alone is enough: target and title become optional, and the host fetches the PR into a registered checkout of its repository and pins the current PR head and GitHub diff base, titled from the PR. When a review for that PR exists, it is returned instead, reporting whether its head moved and the id of any live lease on it; update it in place, move its target with review_set_target, or create a separate review with reuseExisting. kind:"scratchpad" names the one scratchpad, which the host creates itself. The result carries review, the review as review_list shows it: its target with resolved commits, origin (its PR), repositoryName and repositoryPath, so no follow-up read is needed before diffing. When Desktop is available the review opens there and the result reports opened, softwareMapEnabled and environmentIssues, as review_open does; set open:false to author in the background without taking over Desktop.',
    set_target:
      "Change the review target, preserving document and component IDs. Returns warnings for source references needing repair. Earlier versions keep their retained source.",
    edit: 'Edit a document component. Common content shapes: section `{"type":"section","title":"…","children":[]}`; prose `{"type":"markdown","markdown":"…"}`. Sections require `children` (not `blocks`); Markdown uses `markdown` (not `text`). To populate a section later, insert content with `edit.parentId` set to its returned ID. Animation: `{"type":"animation","title":"Request","description":"A request moves to its handler.","html":"<div>Request</div>","css":"div { color: var(--accent); }","js":"animation.onFrame(({ elapsedMs }) => { /* draw a frame */ });","bindings":[]}`. Desktop only, offline, no imports or external resources. Use animation.onFrame for managed pause/resume. Put data-animation-key attributes on DOM/SVG objects to make them clickable code-exploration targets; for Canvas objects register their CSS-pixel bounds with animation.region(key, {x,y,width,height}) during drawing and call animation.select(key) on click. Play/Pause and Restart are shared host controls; do not draw your own controls or View code buttons. Clicking a bound object opens the same code-exploration panel as other diagrams. bindings is an array of {key, links:[{label, source}]} with verified source ranges; multiple named links are supported. Theme variables are --background, --foreground, --muted, --accent, --border and --font. Source edits save silently and apply on Restart; runtime state is not persisted. HTML is limited to 128 KiB of characters, CSS and JS to 64 KiB each, height to 160–1200 pixels. Use native DOM, SVG, Canvas and Web Animations APIs; do not use unmanaged timers. Flow diagram: `{"type":"flow_diagram","title":"Flow","nodes":[{"key":"a","label":"Start"},{"key":"b","label":"Finish"}],"edges":[{"from":"a","to":"b"}]}`. Use nodes and edges arrays (not children); at least one node is required, edges may be empty, and edge endpoints name unique node keys. Code peek: `{"type":"code_peek","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"head","line":10},"end":{"side":"head","line":20}}}`. Call stack diff: `{"type":"call_stack_diff","title":"Request flow","base":[{"label":"Entry","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"base","line":10},"end":{"side":"base","line":20}}}],"head":[{"label":"Entry","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"head","line":10},"end":{"side":"head","line":20}}}]}`. Both base and head arrays are required; either may be empty. Each frame requires source; optional key/parentKey express nesting, and parentKey must name an earlier frame on that side. Sequence: `{"type":"sequence","title":"Request","actors":{"a":"Client","b":"Server"},"steps":[{"from":"a","to":"b","label":"Send","explanation":"Client sends a request."}]}`. actors is a key-to-label object; steps reference actor keys and each needs exactly one of source, explanation, or code. Database lens: `{"type":"database_lens","title":"Read items","actors":{"app":"App"},"stores":{"db":{"label":"DB","storage":"relational","collections":{"items":{"label":"Items","fields":{"id":{"label":"ID","dataType":"integer"}}}}}},"useCases":[{"label":"Load","operations":[{"kind":"read","actor":"app","store":"db","collection":"items","label":"Fetch items","source":{"file":"src/app.ts","start":{"side":"head","line":10},"end":{"side":"head","line":20}}}]}]}`. actors, stores, collections, and fields are keyed objects; useCases and operations are arrays. Include at least one store and use case, with at least one operation per use case; each operation requires source and must reference declared keys. Source paths are repository-relative; line numbers are 1-based and inclusive. Replace example paths and lines with verified source ranges. The host assigns short durable IDs; use returned IDs to edit components in place. The result identifies the edited component and, for an insert or replace, its first-level children, so they can be edited without a follow-up read. Accepted edits are saved immediately. Omitted placement appends; on the scratchpad it lands at the top, so insert a multi-block thought bottom-up or chain each block with afterId. null removes an optional field in a patch. While a reader may be watching, write small and often: one paragraph per edit, so the document draws itself as you go. Insert a new diagram whole, with all its nodes and edges or steps; the board traces it in one quick pass. Change a diagram already on the board one unit at a time: insert, update or remove a flow_node, flow_edge or step by ID (parentId names the diagram). Link each added flow_node to a node already drawn, so it arrives attached; a separate flow_edge is only for two nodes that already exist. Removing a flow_node removes its edges.',

Requires the lenses lease: review_activity_begin with scope:"lenses", which another agent can hold while the document lease is held elsewhere.
